Getting and Cleaning Data project
=================================

This project contains one script, run_analysis.R, that will
provide you with two data sets created from the data at
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

The first, data.csv, contains the average and standard deviation
measurements for each subject and activity from the data set.

The second, tidy.csv, contains the average of each of the measurments
from the data.csv set grouped by each subject and activity.

For the script to properly work, all data from the link above
should be in a directory called "data" at the same level as the
run_analysis.R script.
